Unique emphasis on analyzing employee behavior, including activities like sleeping or leaving the office early.
 Assessment of performance and decision-making based on the analysis, including salary deductions and potential job termination.
Comprehensive record keeping of activities and reasons for salary deductions to provide concrete evidence.
Implementation of a comprehensive dashboard showcasing employees' productive working hours.
Information about employee's productive working hours is communicated through channels like WhatsApp, SMS, or email.
Accumulation of multiple penalties leads to the assignment of a black mark to the employee.
Surpassing the threshold for black marks triggers a direct message to the manager, highlighting performance issues.
The manager has the authority to temporarily pause or hold the detection process for employees who finish work early or require permission due to personal matters.
Fairness and flexibility are promoted by considering individual circumstances while maintaining transparency and accountability.
The project employs facial recognition technology to detect the face of employees within their cabin or office.
Advanced algorithms are used to decode and analyze the captured facial images.
Facial parameters are extracted and compared with stored datasets to verify employee identity and presence.
The system analyzes employee behavior, including activities such as sleeping or leaving the office earlier than scheduled.
Based on behavior analysis, deductions may be made from the employee's salary on a daily basis or even result in job loss.
The project maintains a comprehensive record of activities and reasons for salary deductions as proof and documentation.
